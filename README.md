# Moccarduino

Mocking environment for testing Arduino code. The sole objective of this project is to provide testing platform that could be used in
[ReCodEx](https://github.com/ReCodEx) for testing Arduino student assignments.

The emulator is operating on the well defined API. We are not simulating any low-level aspects of the actual processors used on Arduino boards.
On the other hand, we also implement support for Funshield which contains 3 buttons, 4 independent LEDs, and 4 digit 7-segment LED display controlled by shift register filled from Arduino over serial link.


## Code Overview

The most important part of the code is in `shared` directory. The surrounding projects are mainly designed to demonstrate and test the code.

- `constants.hpp` holds all constants and macros as defined in Arduino IDE
- `interface.hpp`, `interface.cpp` implements the low-level API for the tested Arduino code
- `funshield.h` holds additional constants needed for the Funshield (this header is given to students for development)
- `emulator.hpp` implements the actual state of the arduino board and provides object oriented interface (wich is recalled from C `interface`)
- `simulation.hpp` uses the `emulator.hpp` and implements controller for the simulation
- `simulation_funshield.hpp` uses `simulation.hpp` and implements higher-level of simulation routines targeting specifically Funshield applications
